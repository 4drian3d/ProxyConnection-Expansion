# ProxyConnection Expansion

This expansion allows you to obtain information from your proxy, whether it be Velocity(recommended) or bungeecord.

Supports Fabric, Sponge, and Paper.

However, in Fabric, it must be installed together with the https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-plugin-messaging mod.
This is done to ensure a standard usage of the Bungee plugin message channel.
